# GDPR Checklist

This tool can be found within the admin configuration. The GDPR checklist tool can be used to make sure that your site is GDPR compliant. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/gdpr-checklist.png)

The tool consists of the following sections for site admins to complete.

## Getting Started

The getting started tab has the following questions within it:

> Yes, I agree that by using the _GDPR_ module, I'm still accountable for personal data handling performed on the site.

> Yes, I have read at least one of the following recommended resources from the list below

## Policies and other measures

The policies and other measures tab has the following checkbox within it:

> Cookie policy

## Content related suggestions

The content related section automatically searches for nodes containing a: "Privacy Policy", "Terms of Use", "About us" or "Impressum". If they're not configured already, you will be prompted to configure them on the [Content link configuration page](content-links.md).

The content related suggestions page also has the following checkboxes:

> I have checked through the site's content and verified that a page containing Privacy Policy exists and has been published to this site.

> I confirm the existing "Privacy Policy" or similar page has been published.

> I confirm the published "Privacy Policy" or similar page is included in at least one menu of the site.

## Site feature related suggestions

This group of checkpoints addresses various actions to be taken regarding site features:

> Yes, I'm aware there are external traffic measurement and user tracking services integrated on this site

> Yes, I'm aware there are connections established between this site and some social media platforms

> I confirm that all Drupal core, community, and custom modules have been revised as to not gather any unnecessary personal data of site visitors

> I have examined all aspects of displayed personal data, associated with this site, to ensure that all users can access only permitted types of information according to their role

## Configuration

Checkboxes here allow you to make changes in your site configuration:

> Allow users to cancel their own user account

> Users need to be able to request for removal of all their personal data.

## Beyond website management

Further checkboxes within this tab ensure that the site admin has taken all steps necessary to ensure compliance:

> I have found and consulted with a legal adviser

> I have enabled all features of the GDPR module

> I declare that I am able to notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours in the case of a personal data breach

> I confirm that I have understood that the responsibility of personal data logging is dependent on the size of my organisation as described below:
>
> * Has fewer than 250 employees the processing it carries out is likely no result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is only occasional and the processing does not includes special categories of data \(Article 30/5\) and as such my organisation is not required to create records of processing activities
> * My organisation has 250 or more employees and records of processing activities have been prepared according to Article 30 of the regulationâ€‹
