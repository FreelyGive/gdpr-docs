## Perform SAR as user

A user can perform a SAR from their user dashboard by clicking on ‘All your data’ and then ‘My data requests’. Clicking the button ‘Request data export’ will allow the user to request a SAR, the user will see a message saying ‘You request has been logged’ to inform them off a successful request and must wait for a admin to process the request.
